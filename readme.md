# Simple PHP Website

I put together this project while introducing a friend of mine to PHP. I decided to clean it up a bit and put it on Github so anyone new to PHP can have a taste of a very simple and minimal website built with PHP.

This project is meant for absolute beginners. I've intentionally kept it the most minimal possible while introducing some separation of concerns.

## Concepts

Basically we have created a pipline of the app  and deploy it on a particular node which can be access through its public ip with port no.
